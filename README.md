Blinkit Sales and Performance Analysis Dashboard

Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to conduct a in-depth analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution.
• Identified key insights and opportunities for business optimization by visualizing and analyzing complex datasets.
• Tracked and visualized core Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Customer Rating, to provide a high-level overview of business health.
• Conducted granular analysis by segmenting sales data by product attributes (Fat Content, Item Type) and outlet characteristics (Establishment Type, Location, Size).
• Evaluated the impact of outlet and product factors on revenue by creating detailed reports on sales by item type, fat content per outlet, and sales by outlet establishment type.
• Created targeted visualizations to analyze the correlation between outlet size and sales percentage, assess the geographic distribution of sales by location, and provide a multi-metric breakdown by outlet type.
